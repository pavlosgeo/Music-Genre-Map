    artists: ['The Beatles', 'Led Zeppelin', 'Queen'],
    roots: 'Rock music developed in the late 1940s and 1950s out of African-American blues, rhythm and blues, gospel, and elements of country and rockabilly. Early pioneers such as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley emphasized electric guitars and a strong backbeat; over the following decades rock split into many subgenres (hard rock, progressive rock, punk, metal, indie) and became a dominant global popular-music culture, associated with youth, rebellion, and stylistic innovation.',

    artists: ['The Ramones', 'Sex Pistols', 'The Clash'],
    roots: 'Punk rock arose in the mid-1970s in the US and UK as a backlash to what many musicians saw as bloated, commercial mainstream rock. Drawing on 1960s garage rock and protopunk acts (e.g., The Stooges, MC5), punk favored short, fast songs, raw production, and an explicit DIY, anti-authoritarian ethos—lyrics often tackled social and political frustrations and spawned a vibrant independent scene and subculture.',
